# Predict Elections

This website uses polling data provided by the WSJ coupled with census data to more accurately predict the 2016 California Primary between Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. 

The server uses node.js to route different queries to/from a `sqlite` database and various API calls. The front end is completed with vanilla JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and D3.js. 

In order to run site, run `npm` on the needed modules, then `node index.js` to start up the server. Point your browser to `localhost:8080`.
